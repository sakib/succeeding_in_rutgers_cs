# Academics


## Invest heavily in CS 111 (Intro) and CS 112 (Data Structures)
> These are super important courses full of foundational knowledge. Your goal at the end of these should be to be able to confidently explain how to reverse a linked list or how to implement a hash table. Afterwards, advanced concepts will be much, much easier to grasp if you thoroughly understand the simpler concepts, and the simpler concepts more or less comprises the lion’s share of what’s asked in technical interviews anyway. There’s a ton of resources to fall back on if you’re struggling in these, too, especially [Code Red](https://resources.cs.rutgers.edu/docs/rooms-equipment/cave/). In general, good grades will come naturally if you invest time and energy into truly understanding and engaging with the course material. CS 111 and CS 112 give you a ton of time to do assignments and the community is literally designed to support you academically.


## Plan for and focus on growth
> You also have to be intentional about your growth. Freshmen should plan out their four years at Rutgers, degrees and all. This is my [four-year schedule](https://pastebin.com/zzkgPp7f) that I templated out in freshman year and adjusted throughout the years - it took weeks to make, and only worked out because I came in with a lot of AP credits, but it acted as a pretty helpful lodestone for me when I picked out my classes.

> If you’re thinking about the 5-year BS-MS degree, or if you want to complete the degree in 2 or 3 years, you need to start planning for credit-intensive semesters starting freshman or sophomore year.


## Be annoying and ask questions habitually
> I have countless memories of a teacher asking the class a question and the entire room being silent. From a teacher’s perspective, it’s even more awkward: you didn’t really ask it so that the same few people would answer (you already know they probably know it). You just wanted the people who are struggling to speak up and ask you to clarify something that they--and the rest of the class--don’t understand. It sounds dumb, but try to sit in the front of the class and ask questions whenever you don’t understand something - chances are, most other people didn’t either. I followed this myself and even though I felt dumb when I asked my questions, tons of people would later say to me, “hey Sakib, thanks for asking that in class, I had no idea what was going on”.


## Compartmentalize, and focus
> Life quickly gets overwhelming if you think about everything you have to do at once. Instead, focus on one thing at a time. Keep a comprehensive and categorized list of literally everything you have to do, and at the beginning of every day, pull things from this list into a “Today” section, and make sure you get them done today. [I used Pastebin for this](https://pastebin.com/JkCJZrVK), but many people I know use spreadsheets. Whatever you like. Trust your list, and trust your calendar to tell you when and where you have to be and what you have to do. Once it’s on your list, it’s out of your mind and you can stop thinking about it.

> Sometimes you have to context-switch really quickly: you could have a CS lecture followed by a phone interview, then have to go to office hours for a math course, then have a work shift, somehow figure out how and when to eat a meal, reimburse some people for a club expense, all the while worrying about your paper due tomorrow, and this could be one of your light days. At the same time, this prepares you really well for your working life. The only things that will help here are a tight calendar and a strong support network.


## How to handle deadlines and get into your zone
> Say you go to your CS 214 lecture and they assign you a project that’s due in a month. This deadline is both dangerous and misleading - you should get this done as soon as humanly possible :)

> I would pull late-nighters the day after large projects were assigned so that I could get into the zone, a place where I could be on my own and focus, spend uninterrupted hours solving a specific problem. I don’t recommend this specifically - I’ve struggled a lot with enforcing self-care and structure in my life - but being proactive with my work was crucial to my own growth and sanity. I could spend the next month not worrying about the project, focusing on other things, and helping out my peers when I had the chance. This has the added benefit of making you look smart, which helps out your reputation.

> One drawback of this approach is that your peers who do the project later get the benefit of extra help or insight from the professor; I’ve had classmates say “oh I finished in 4 hours” and make me feel bad for spending 4 days on something. But this isn’t that big of a drawback; you solved the problem on your own, and that’s a huge thing for your own growth in general.


## Build your support network
> You should find tight groups of friends that are smarter than you early on. You can utilize these resources as support networks and study groups; I would have gone insane without my support networks, and I would have bombed many classes without my study groups. You’ll naturally build more of these depending on how much time you spend in community spaces, how warm your presence is, how you present yourself, and what classes you choose to take. 


## Actively seek out mentors
> Introduce yourself to upperclassmen - most of them are cool people who love to teach younger people and talk about themselves. I would often go into the CAVE, find an upperclassman and shake their hands, ask them what classes they’re taking, and if they could teach me something that they learned recently. I learned about a ton of cool stuff this way pretty early on: how the Linux OS handles clock ticks, what virtualization is, how distributed systems work, what are HTTP REST APIs, how the Internet works, etc. This has the added benefit of building your network and netting you friends to go to parties with.


## Actively seek to help others
> I shouldn’t need to explain this much. This is how you leave a legacy, make things better for the next generation, grow as a person and communicator yourself, and build your reputation. It also evolves into something you can use to motivate yourself and build up your support network. I started taking mentees in sophomore year by asking freshmen if they wanted to learn about the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model), and to this day they’re my best friends.

> One of the main draws of the iLab Assistant position at the CAVE is that it helps you become a natural communicator which makes it easier to do well in interviews. As an interviewer, it’s pretty clear when someone can communicate their ideas effectively and when they can’t.


## Take graduate courses
> The earlier you figure out what you would like to specialize in, the more time you have to explore deeper concepts at Rutgers. As a freshman, my mentors recommended that I check out the Rutgers graduate course portfolio and picked out a few tracks that I knew I wanted to do by my end: Algorithms, Networking, and Machine Learning - and I took all the relevant electives and ended up taking 9 grad courses by the time I graduated. I found grad courses much more enjoyable than undergrad courses, since there’s a lot more freedom to explore what you want, less focus on exams, and more leniency. Also, most undergraduate electives have a graduate equivalent, and the graduate equivalent counts for the undergraduate course. For example, many students opt to take [Graduate Algorithms I](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/courses/design-and-analysis-of-data-structures-and-algorithms) instead of [Algorithms](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/courses/design-and-analysis-of-computer-algorithms). I opted to take both of them and found that Undergrad Algo covered a great breadth of topics and Grad Algo covered topics in more depth.


## Consider taking alternative courses
> The math department taught Probability Theory (Math 477), which counts for taking Discrete Structures II (CS 206). Since I had the requirements done for 477, I took it at the same time as Discrete Structures I (CS 205), even though 205 is a prerequisite for 206. This opened up my future schedule to have more flexibility, and also made my life easier in the long run since it was easier to ace Math 477 than CS 206. There are other alternative courses that count for CS courses, like Math 300 counts for CS 205 - it’s worth it to find these out on the department websites and plan accordingly.


## Plan out your prerequisites
> Map your [progression](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/undergraduate/computer-science-course-structure) ahead of time, and make sure you get the courses you want with this four-point approach:
> [Request an SPN](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/courses/registration) the semester before if you need one.
> Register for the course as soon as you’re able to, you’ll be able to find schedules for this based on your amount of credits.
> [Course Snipe](http://sniper.rutgers.io/) the sections that work for your schedule (thanks V and Abe Stanway for this). Use the [Course Watcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tevinjeffrey.rutgersct&hl=en_US) chrome extension in addition to Course Sniper.
> Hunt down the professor for the course you want, email them, go to their office hours, go to the first lecture of the course, and generally annoy them until they promise to let you in the course. This is much easier if you have a history of good grades.


## Balance breadth and depth for extracurriculars
> I’m not going to tell you to do one club or another, but you should already know that it’s a great way to grow personally and grow your portfolio to be involved in student orgs. It’s best to initially explore everything that you have an interest in and diversify your extracurriculars. Later on in your college career, it’s best to pick a handful of clubs and communities you vibe with (or start your own) and make an impact in the way you want to be remembered.


## Not all professors are created equal
> Some professors are better than others, and that’s a [rock fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHP8GC6PGTU)! This is a subjective matter and I’m not going to tell you which ones are good or bad, you can ask your mentors about that. If you liked a certain professor, consider taking more of their courses, especially if it’s graduate work. If a certain professor is about as helpful as a sack of bricks, complain to the CS department chair. 


## Textbooks
> College textbooks are expensive. I never bought a textbook in any of my years. Most professors I had said “Make sure you get this textbook” but never actually used the textbook more than once or twice. On the rare occasion I actually needed them, I always was able to either find the relevant pages online or go off of my friends’ textbooks in our study groups. That said, if you want to actually read textbooks or collect them or save them for future reading, go ahead and buy used textbooks.


## Consider doing research
> I haven’t done research myself, but it’s pretty straightforward to get involved in undergraduate research. Some orgs hold Research Fairs where you can talk to professors about what they study, or you can browse professors’ [portfolios](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/people/faculty/professors) yourself, see what’s interesting, reach out to them in-person or via email, get As in their classes and talk to them, and ask to help out. They’ll give you stuff to do if they think you can handle it. It’s a good way to diversify your activities, especially if you’re considering graduate school. Also, you don’t have to just consider CS research, since tech proficiency lends itself to help in so many interdisciplinary research efforts. Rutgers is a research institution, so I’m sure you can Google around.
