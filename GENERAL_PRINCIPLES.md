# General Principles

## Mental health, Impostor Syndrome, and Confidence
First and foremost, take care of yourself and prioritize your personal mental and physical health above classes. Be the first or second person to give yourself a break. Mental health issues are rampant in college, and all of the following advice, and school in general, pale in comparison to what many people go through. Commuters have an entirely different set of struggles than on-campus residents. Check out Rutgers [health services](http://health.rutgers.edu/), get a therapist at CAPS, build a relationship with your professors/deans, adopt a skincare routine, shower every day, be physically active.

You should not feel bad that you have less experience than others when you start college; in general, you shouldn’t feel bad about this when starting anything new. All the older, more experienced people who seem to know what they’re doing were in your shoes at some point.

Most everyone in college has [impostor syndrome](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=imposter+syndrome), and this will persist throughout life. It’s good to acknowledge it but not give that voice in your head much credence. This takes time and effort, more so for some than others. It’s up to you, mainly, to build a solid mental and physical foundation for yourself.


## Adjust your definition of “intelligence”
There are many different [types of intelligence](https://www.cleverism.com/types-of-intelligence/). If you’re the kind of person whose parents always compared them to others, you in particular might be used to thinking that success or intelligence looks a certain way. And that’s okay, and it’s generally good to have role models, but please recognize your own biases about what intelligence means - that means don’t toxically gas people up and put them on pedestals no matter how “successful” they seem, and do look to celebrate the diverse sets of ways that your peers show their intelligence. Also, this should go without saying, but don’t make fun of other majors because they don’t match your biased view of what subjects are worthy to explore.


## Adjust your definition of what is “hard” and what is “easy”
It’s usually pretty clear to see the differences between people who think “hard” means “something that you put a lot of time into but still don’t understand effectively” and people who think “hard” means “anything that takes effort”. The latter kind of person is pretty prevalent at Rutgers and in the world, but try to be the former kind of person. In an extremist opinion, my older brother would say that “nothing is hard, some things are just easier than others.”


## Stretch yourself
When I was a freshman, I asked my older brother: how should I fill up my time when there’s so much to do? When will I know I’ve reached my limit? He said “you’ll never know how big your plate is until there’s so much on it that things start to fall off.” When I started following this, I found that I could handle a lot more than I previously thought myself capable of. Every day I felt myself stretching my capabilities, like muscles growing after undergoing intensive cycles of strain and stretch and rest. And messing up is okay - it’s college, it’s the safest time in your life to mess up. But take this advice with a grain of salt, since he comes from an “age of heroes” where the ideal CS student stayed up all night every night coding up fancy new thingamajigs and playing Smash Bros. You should find your balance between discomfort and comfort. If you feel you can do more or want more from yourself, [lean towards discomfort](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f0/3a/cc/f03acc9fdba523e46841d9d6e362a6bd.jpg).

My older brother would liken self-growth to Pokemon contests -- you know the pentagon that says how Cool or Smart or Cute your pokemon is? Make one for yourself on axes and metrics that you want to measure yourself with and track your progress over time.

## Figure out what you want to do and what you don’t want to do
College is supposed to help you figure yourself out; for many, it’s when you figure out you have an actual personality with your own unique interests. Try to take as many classes as possible in subjects you’d never take normally to extend out of your comfort zone. I took Basic Acting in the Theater department, which was harder for me than any CS course I’ve taken, but I learned a great deal about my emotions and I grew a great respect for actors. I took up to Graduate Algorithms II until I realized that I never want to derive the time complexity of operations on a van Emde Boas tree again.

Why are you at college? Do you want to change the world? How? Do you just want stability and security? Are you in it for just yourself, or also for others? What do you hope post-college you is like? Ask yourself these questions often, like once a week or month. I figured out over time that I personally want to help decide the future of the Internet and social media, and also grow into a prolific engineer so that I can make a big impact in edtech or civic hacking efforts.


## Success is a function of time management and determination
Succeeding in Rutgers CS is less a question of aptitude, and more a question of time management and determination. In other words, it’s not about how talented you are, it’s about what you choose to spend your time on, and how efficiently you spend it. If you think you’re not smart, surprise, everyone thinks that, except incels, which I hope you’re not. There are only a handful of classes that require more talent than hard work. If you’re asking, “does this schedule look doable? I don’t know if I’m smart enough”, you should instead ask yourself, “do I want to commit significant amounts of my headspace this semester to learning and exploring this topic? It’ll take time, but I can do it.”


## Be intentional
College is about getting out of your comfort zone and growing as a professional and a human being. It’s also about figuring out what you want to do with your life. It helps no one in the long run if you take easy-A courses where you know you’ll learn nothing (unless it’s required). Take the tougher professor if you believe that you’ll learn more from it.

It’s great to have [lazy days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLexgOxsZu0) from time to time, but at least on the weekdays, make sure you’re always doing something intentionally. Personally, I tried to be out and about until 10pm everyday. It could be hanging out with friends, studying in a group, working on club stuff, going to a party, arguing with people on Facebook, being proactive about your assignments, hanging around a community space, relaxing to focus on improving your mental health - my point is, [use your time efficiently and intentionally](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/). You’ll feel more control over your life when you don’t accidentally lie in bed from dawn to dusk and suddenly it’s 10pm and the day is gone. These decisions about how you choose to spend your time should be reflected in your Google Calendar, which should basically govern your life through mobile alerts you’ve set for yourself. Seriously, I can’t stress this enough, keep a tight calendar.

It’s important to manage your time well on a macroscale and microscale. Thinking about and planning out what you’re going to do each couple of hours primes you to become more committed and more resolute, a decision maker.


## We spend our adulthoods learning how to cope with our childhoods
This one is just good to keep in mind. You should analyze and acknowledge who you are as a result of how your parents raised you and how that relates to your strengths and weaknesses. For example, I was fortunate enough to have supportive parents who gave me a lot of freedom, but they also did everything for me and didn’t enforce many rules, and so I had trouble prioritizing self-care and structure for myself. Surrounding myself with complementary people whose strengths include implementing structure for themselves helped me address this weakness a lot. You should keep this in mind when you consider your behavior toward yourself and other people.
