## Background

If you ask 100 different Computer Science graduates how to succeed in the CS department, you’re likely to get 100 different answers. But I’m sitting here in my apartment thinking about what I would have told myself when I started at Rutgers. This guide will reflect those thoughts.

I spent 4 years in the CS program and took a whole lot of undergraduate and graduate courses. I was a Learning Assistant for CS111 for one year, a Teaching Assistant for CS112 next year, and a Part-Time Lecturer for CS344 next year. I also taught a First-Year Interest Group Seminar my final year. I was President of Rutgers USACS for 2 years, a HackRU director for 2 years, and a mentor for the hackNY summer fellowship for 2 years.


## Foreword

DISCLAIMER: Most of this doesn’t apply until 25% of the way through your freshman year - initially, just focus on finding your rhythm and getting somewhat comfortable with college life. I talk about a lot of things in this guide and it can get overwhelming, but remember that you have years to consider all these points, and they’ll be pretty busy and transformational years of your life.

I mention often the way I did things; by no means is this the only road to success. Everyone has their own timeline, do what’s best for you, hopefully this makes you think. I’m writing this more for underclassmen, but the points are still valid for upperclassmen. If you’re older and don’t care, just skip to the jobs section or message me on Facebook for referrals.

### Realize that there’s no one way to succeed.
* This doc is already huge, so it can be overwhelming. But all of it is advice made in an attempt to help you be your best. 
* This is a roadmap that worked for one person. Everyone’s path is different. Make the most of your own.
* Figure out what fulfills you. For me, it was organizing and improving the CS community at Rutgers. I sometimes felt like an impostor because my biggest extracurricular involvement was about a community within tech, instead of tech itself. But that was what made me feel like I had an impact. Remember that humans are multidimensional--you can be successful and interesting even if your whole life isn’t about writing code.

### Don’t let fear be the reason behind your choices.
* I avoided applying to jobs and internships for a very long time because I thought I would be exposed as a total failure. Turns out this thought process was a waste of my own time that never did anything useful for me, but the only thing I could see at the time was my fear of failure. It’s okay to be afraid--everyone is. Just don’t let that stop you, because it’s not worth it.
* Work on replacing your fear of the unknown with curiosity about it. Even if you don’t know how your job search will work out, you’ll be better off if you have experience with interviews and job applications. If you’re afraid that a certain class will be too hard, remember that others have taken it before you, and there’s no inherent reason you can’t do it too. 
* Embrace uncertainty. Stand up for your notions, but get comfortable with being wrong and admitting it, because the best solution can only be found if you’re willing to find it. This is not only important in CS interviews, jobs, and classes, but also in general.
* Surround yourself with people who encourage you and push you to do more and be better, even if you’re afraid. You won’t grow if you live in your bubble of fear.

### Try to gain an understanding of how people work.
* People who loudly brag about their careers/interviews/skills/classes (or look down on those of others) are doing it out of their own insecurities. Don’t let that become an insecurity of yours.
* Just because someone is loud and outspoken does not mean they are right.
* Tech has a long way to go when it comes to being inclusive. Educate yourself on this, and do not shy away from the different experiences it creates for different people. Understand how it influences your own experience. Listen to others’ experiences so that you can understand, not just so that you can figure out the best way to disagree.
* Aim to grow. You can’t be your high school self forever. 
* Check in on your own thoughts and behaviors often. Don’t be a jerk. No one likes a jerk.

### Do what you enjoy. 
* You’re in charge of your own life. Keep an open mind and do anything that piques your interest or curiosity, but don’t feel obligated to owe anyone by fitting into their needs or vision of yourself.
* One story in particular: I personally struggled with this a ton while I was applying for full time roles. Because as a CS grad, it felt like there was an engineering-esque mold I was expected to fill. Whilst I was applying to full-time software engineering roles, I realized I was only doing it because “it’s the right thing to do” because I never programmed outside of projects and assignments. In the end, I tested my luck at a community oriented role at Major League Hacking and I learned I really, really love seeing people grow (and I don’t count down the minutes until I get to leave the office!). 

### You are worth someone else’s time and energy. 
* Your mental health directly impacts your school and social life. The best thing you can do for yourself is know you aren’t alone and that you have a support system around you to help you. 
* Over time and experience, I learned that after speaking to someone about my thoughts and emotions, I immediately bounce back from the dark, unwanted pits of my brain. But, my need to find that “someone” was blocked by my insecurities of not feeling good enough to deserve one. During sophomore year, I came across my “someone” who showed me that they cared about my life and it did wonders for my mental health, self-confidence, and, ultimately, academics. 

### Reflect and recognize your personal growth every semester. 
* As you go through the motions of school, you’re constantly fighting an upward battle as classes get harder and more responsibilities are piled on. The constant need to get better, compare yourself to others, and learn more can take a toll on your confidence as a person, but remember where you started from! 
* During my sophomore year, I was constantly comparing myself to my friends who were in higher level classes or more leadership positions. As a result, I would question my own abilities because I wasn’t where they were, even though they were the same age or younger than me. However, I also remembered that I was the high schooler who played games all day long and did the absolute minimum to pass classes. In just 1 year, I realized I grew so much that I barely believed all I accomplished and it pushed me to continue growing.
